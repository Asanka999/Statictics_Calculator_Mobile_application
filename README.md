# Statictics_Calculator_Mobile_application
The Statistics Calculator Mobile App is designed to help users quickly compute fundamental statistical measures such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation, along with other advanced calculations. The app will also include graphical visualizations to help users better understand their data.

Key Features
📊 Basic Statistical Calculations
Mean (Average): Calculates the sum of all values divided by the number of values.

Median: Finds the middle value in a dataset.

Mode: Determines the most frequently occurring number(s).

Variance: Measures the spread of numbers in the dataset.

Standard Deviation: Calculates how much data varies from the mean.

📈 Graphical Visualizations
Histograms: Show the distribution of data.

Box Plots: Identify outliers and distribution spread.

Scatter Plots: Display relationships between variables.

Pie Charts & Bar Graphs: Represent categorical data clearly.

📂 Data Input Options
Manual Input: Users can enter values manually.

File Upload: Support for CSV, Excel, and other data formats.

Real-time Data Entry: Automatically updates calculations as new data is entered.

⚙️ Advanced Features (Optional)
Regression Analysis: Simple linear regression to analyze relationships between variables.

Hypothesis Testing: Includes t-tests and chi-square tests.

Probability Distributions: Calculate values for normal, binomial, and Poisson distributions.

Data Export: Save and share results as PDF, CSV, or Excel files.

Technology Stack
📱 Frontend (Mobile App UI)
Flutter (Dart) or React Native for cross-platform development.

Native Android (Kotlin) or iOS (Swift) for platform-specific apps.
